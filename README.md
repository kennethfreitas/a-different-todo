## Day 1

- Manager: Oh! Are you a Developer? I have an incredible idea for an app, can you build this for me?

- Developer: Hmm, yes?

- Manager: Oh, this is fantastic! I have a company where I  manage a lot of people and give to them a lot of work, but everyone always forgets something... So I had the incredible idea to create an application that I can write jobs that need to be done and mark the responsible to do the work, let's start?

### Day 1 - Conclusion

Ignoring all project setup, like add Docker support, test framework, dependency injection tool and etc. As you can see all the solution was solved on the service layer inside the component from the domain, because it's really the basis for the flow, the private method was created only to bring a more declarative way when someone will try to read the code.
