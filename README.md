## Day 3

- Manager: Oh, so... the issue is... everyone ignores my tasks and always has something more important to do, when people start to work on the taks, it's already too late... Don't you think it would be nice if each task have a due date?

### Day 3 - Conclusion

Before starting, I know that the library "class-validator" has the decorator "@MaxDate" that verifies if the date is in the future, but I didn't have any idea how to bring some logic to the app to demonstrate that the facade is clean, so we introduce private method to better reuse and keep simple all in one file.
